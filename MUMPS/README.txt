MUMPS - My Uni Medical Practice System

GitHub repository: https://github.com/Squidgeypea/Soft252_cw
There is also a project board on GitHub which has been used throughout the coursework.

Description:
This program uses the strategy and factory design patterns.

Credits:
Draw.io was used for the UML diagrams.
NetBeans was used to develop the program.
XML was used for data storage.
DOM was used for XML parsing, etc.
JavaDoc was used for comments.
JUnit was used for tests.

Things I did successfully:
Used MVC architecture.
Implemented strategy pattern.
Implemented factory pattern.
Used inheritence, interfaces and abstraction.
Got login to send user to the correct place based on their username (A..., D..., P... or S...).
Read data from XML into combo boxes.
Created GUI JFrames for all parts of the program, for all users.
Made buttons direct the user to the right place.
Drew UML diagrams.
Made Javadoc.
Made some JUnit tests.

Things I started but didn't finish on time:
Exception handling.
Writing data to XML.
Displaying some data on GUI, eg. Table of doctor information.
Optimising code and making it better in terms of SOLID in some places, eg. PopulateLists class.
Some functionalities, eg. Prescribe medicine to a patient, etc.
Password checking.
