MUMPS - My Uni Medical Practice System

GitHub repository: https://github.com/Squidgeypea/Soft252_cw

Description:
This program uses the strategy and factory design patterns.
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the application on time which was a shame because I 
had a strong plan of how I was going to do it, and it was coming together nicely. 
I got some sort of problem for a while with my eyes where I felt sick and vertiginous whenever 
I looked at a computer screen and it made me feel unwell, so I couldn't continue doing the work.
After that I didn't have time to catch up.
