MUMPS - My Uni Medical Practice System

GitHub repository: https://github.com/Squidgeypea/Soft252_cw
There is also a project board on GitHub which has been used throughout the coursework.

Description:
This program uses the strategy and factory design patterns.
Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the application on time which was a shame because I 
had a strong plan of how I was going to do it, and it was coming together nicely. 
I got some sort of problem for a while with my eyes where I felt sick and vertiginous whenever 
I looked at a computer screen and it made me feel unwell, so I couldn't continue doing the work.
After that I didn't have time to catch up.

Credits:
Draw.io was used for the UML diagrams.
NetBeans was used to develop the program.
XML was used for data storage.
JavaDoc was used for comments.
JUnit was used for tests.

Things I did successfully:
Used MVC architecture.
Implemented strategy pattern.
Implemented factory pattern.
Used inheritence, interfaces and abstraction.
Got login to send user to the correct place based on their username (A..., D..., P... or S...).
Read data from XML into combo boxes.
Created GUI JFrames for all parts of the program, for all users.
Made buttons direct the user to the right place.
Drew UML diagrams.
Made Javadoc.

Things I didn't finish:
Password checking.
Exception handling.
JUnit tests.
Writing data to XML.
Displaying some data on GUI, eg. Table of doctor information.
Optimising code and making it better in terms of SOLID in some places, eg. PopulateLists class.
Some functionalities, eg. Prescribe medicine to a patient, etc.
